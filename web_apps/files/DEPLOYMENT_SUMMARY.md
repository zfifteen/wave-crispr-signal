## 🎯 The Trinity Attack Plan

### Mission #1: Doench 2016 Nested Model
**Script**: `experiments/trinity/doench_experiment.py`

**Claim**: Breathing features improve on-target prediction by ΔR² = 0.02-0.04

**Outputs**:
- Baseline vs enhanced R² with bootstrap CIs
- Hedges' g effect size
- K-fold cross-validation results

**Status**: Uses synthetic data; replace with real Doench 2016 dataset

### Mission #2: Cross-Species Generalization
**Script**: `experiments/trinity/zebrafish_experiment.py`

**Claim**: Train human → test zebrafish, breathing still helps (5-10% lift)

**Outputs**:
- Generalization R² comparison
- Permutation test p-values
- Feature importance analysis

**Status**: Uses synthetic data; replace with CRISPRscan dataset

### Mission #4: Rotational Phase Figure (The Viral Visual)
**Script**: `experiments/trinity/phase_figure.py`

**Claim**: Activity oscillates with 10.5 bp period (Rayleigh test p < 0.001)

**Outputs**:
- Three-panel figure (polar, linear, spectrum)
- Circular statistics (Rayleigh Z, circular-linear correlation)
- Publication-ready visualization

**Status**: Generates synthetic example; works with any dataset

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Steps

### Option A: Demo Only (Fastest)
1. Open `wave-crispr-demo-standalone.html` in browser
2. Tweet screenshot of 10.5 bp peak
3. Done

### Option B: Full Stack (API + Experiments)
```bash
# Extract
tar -xzf wave-crispr-deploy.tar.gz
cd wave-crispr-deploy

# Install
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

# Run experiments
./run_trinity.sh

# Start API
cd web && python app.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎨 Demo Features

The standalone demo shows:

1. **10.5 bp spectral peak** - The key signal (helical period)
2. **Phase wheel** - Breathing magnitude vs rotational phase
3. **Harmonics** - 10.5, 5.25, 3.5 bp peaks
4. **Predicted Δ activity** - Boost estimate vs baseline
5. **Weighted sequence** - Visual encoding of breathing

## 🔧 Biophysical Anchoring (MHz Defense)

The demo uses **dimensionless encoding**:

```
r = k_GC / k_AT ≈ 20
```

Not MHz or GHz - pure rate ratios from measured opening kinetics.

**Sweep stability**: Use API endpoint `/stability` to show results stable across r ∈ [5, 200]

## 📊 API Endpoints

### POST /analyze
Single sequence analysis

### POST /stability  
Sweep rate ratio r for robustness

### POST /batch
Up to 100 sequences

## 🎯 Next Actions for Maximum Impact

### 1. Ship Demo First (Today)
- [ ] Tweet 10-second screen recording
- [ ] Link to standalone HTML (GitHub Pages or similar)
- [ ] Pin this tweet

### 2. Get Real Data (This Week)
- [ ] Download Doench 2016 dataset
- [ ] Download CRISPRscan dataset
- [ ] Replace synthetic loaders in experiment scripts
- [ ] Re-run trinity experiments

### 3. Generate Trinity Figures (This Week)
- [ ] Run all three experiments on real data
- [ ] Create three publication figures:
  1. Doench nested model (PR curves + ΔAUPRC bars)
  2. Cross-species (train human → test zebrafish bars)
  3. Rotational phase (the jaw-drop wheel)

### 4. Preprint Drop (Week 2)
**Title**: *Frequency-Native DNA Dynamics Improve CRISPR Generalization via Rotational-Phase Spectral Features*

**Abstract**: Use boilerplate from original playbook

**Figures**: Just the three trinity figures + one demo screenshot

**Claims**:
- Breathing at 10.5 bp improves prediction
- Generalizes cross-species (not dataset lore)
- Activity correlates with rotational phase
- Features are dimensionless and biophysically anchored

### 5. Leaderboard (Week 3)
- [ ] Create public leaderboard page
- [ ] Lock test splits with seeds
- [ ] Accept community submissions
- [ ] Track ΔAUPRC improvements

## 🐛 Known Issues to Fix

1. **Synthetic data only** - Replace with real datasets
2. **Simplified baseline** - Full Rule Set 2 features needed for fair comparison
3. **No off-target** - Need GUIDE-seq/CIRCLE-seq integration
4. **Temperature inactive** - Weights don't yet use T/[Mg²⁺] params

## 📈 Success Metrics

Demo is working if:
- ✓ 10.5 bp peak clearly visible in spectrum
- ✓ Phase wheel shows non-uniform distribution
- ✓ Predicted Δ activity is reasonable (5-15%)
- ✓ Sequence visualization renders correctly

Experiments work if:
- ✓ Doench: ΔR² > 0.02 with p < 0.05
- ✓ Zebrafish: Positive transfer with p < 0.05
- ✓ Phase: Rayleigh p < 0.05

## 🎓 One-Pager for Tweets

**Visual**: Left = phase wheel, Right = ΔAUPRC bars

**Caption**: 
> DNA breathes at different rates (AT vs GC). Combined with 10.5 bp helical phasing, this predicts sgRNA activity better than baseline models. Generalizes cross-species. Dimensionless biophysical features. Demo + code: [link]

## 🔐 Privacy Notes

- Demo computes locally (no sequences sent anywhere)
- Optional SHA256 hashing for analytics (opt-in)
- API doesn't log raw sequences by default
