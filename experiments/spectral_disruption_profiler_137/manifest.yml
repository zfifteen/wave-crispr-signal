notes: |
  This experiment is designed to FALSIFY the core hypotheses of the Spectral 
  Disruption Profiler by testing conditions under which phase weighting θ′(n,k) 
  with k* ≈ 0.300 fails to enhance FFT-based disruption metrics or provide 
  predictive lift in gRNA efficiency.
  
  The experiment integrates elements from:
  - unified-framework: Z = A(B/c) invariants, κ(n) curvature with kappa_geo=0.3
  - z-sandbox: Geodesic Validation Assault for embedding, QMC sampling
  - existing wave-crispr-signal modules: FFT analysis, phase weighting
  
  Success criterion: Demonstrating that phase-weighted analysis provides NO 
  significant benefit over unweighted baseline, thus falsifying the hypothesis.

future_work:
  - "Extend to multi-guide screening datasets"
  - "Test across broader k-parameter ranges"
  - "Compare with RuleSet3 on real Kim 2025 data"
  - "Integrate with conical_flow.py density corrections"
  - "Test GVA embedding on non-prime-like disruptions"
