## Smoke Test Expected Results
- All 7 tests must pass
- Runtime must be < 5 seconds
- Exit code: 0

## DNA Validation Gate
- Valid bases: A, C, G, T, N (case-insensitive)
- Invalid: U (RNA), IUPAC codes (R, Y, etc.), numbers, special chars
- Empty sequences must be rejected

## Complex Encoding Verification
- A → 1+0j
- T → -1+0j
- C → 0+1j
- G → 0-1j
- N → 0+0j

## θ′(n,k) Geometric Resolution
- θ′(0, k) ≈ 0 (zero position)
- θ′(n, k) bounded: 0 ≤ θ′ ≤ 10 for reasonable n
- Formula: φ·((n mod φ_period)/φ_period)^k
- Default: φ_period = 21.0, k = 0.3

## FFT Features Required Keys
- dominant_freq (float)
- spectral_entropy (float)
- sidelobe_count (integer)
- gc_content (float, 0-1)
- sequence_length (integer)
- phase_weighted (boolean)

## Synthetic Sequence Generation
- Generated count matches requested
- All sequences have correct length
- All bases are valid DNA (A/C/G/T)
- GC content within requested range (±10% tolerance)

## Z Framework Integration
- ZFrameworkCalculator must be initialized
- High precision: mp.dps = 50
- Constants: φ ≈ 1.618, e² ≈ 7.389

## Performance Targets
- Smoke test: < 5 seconds for 10 sequences
- Functional test: < 30 seconds for 100 sequences
- Full experiment: < 5 minutes for 1000 sequences with 1000 bootstrap + 1000 permutation

## Falsification Status Values
- HYPOTHESIS_FALSIFIED: CI includes zero AND p > α (expected result)
- HYPOTHESIS_SUPPORTED: CI excludes zero AND p < α (unexpected)
- INCONCLUSIVE: Mixed results

## Statistical Requirements
- Bootstrap resamples: ≥1,000 (100 for smoke test)
- Permutation resamples: ≥1,000 (100 for smoke test)
- Significance level α: 0.05
- Bootstrap CI level: 95% (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles)

## Output File Structure
- JSON format with proper indentation
- All required fields present (see expected_structure.json)
- Numeric values are valid floats/integers (not NaN/Inf)
- Timestamps in YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format
- Git commit hash recorded

## Metadata Requirements
- timestamp: ISO-like format
- python_version: Full version string
- experiment_id: "spectral_disruption_profiler_137"
- version: "1.0"
- git_commit: Short hash or "unknown"

## Expected Falsification Result
For synthetic random data with no real signal:
- Bootstrap CI should typically include zero
- Permutation p-value should be > 0.05
- Status: "HYPOTHESIS_FALSIFIED"
- Conclusion: "Phase weighting provides NO significant improvement"

This is the expected outcome as the experiment is designed to test
conditions where phase weighting does NOT provide benefit.
