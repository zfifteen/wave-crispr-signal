# Z5D Prime Predictor Performance Analysis: CORRECTED Experimental Report

## Executive Summary

This experiment tested the hypothesis that the Z5D prime predictor achieves lower 
relative errors than the LI predictor for large n values, potentially leading to 
observable speedups in CRISPR simulation applications.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: The original implementation incorrectly mixed approximations 
for π(x) (prime counting function) with p_n (nth prime) formulas. This corrected 
version properly implements p_n predictors throughout.

## Methods

### Predictors Tested (CORRECTED)
1. **Z5D Predictor**: Five-term asymptotic expansion for nth prime
   - Formula: p_n ≈ n*ln(n) + n*ln(ln(n)) - n + n*ln(ln(n))/ln(n) - n + n*((ln(ln(n)))² - 6*ln(ln(n)) + 11)/(2*(ln(n))²)

2. **LI Predictor**: Four-term logarithmic integral baseline for nth prime
   - Formula: p_n ≈ n*ln(n) + n*ln(ln(n)) - n + n*ln(ln(n))/ln(n)

### Experimental Setup
- **Range**: n ∈ [1,000,000, 10,000,000]
- **Samples**: 10 logarithmically spaced test points
- **Precision**: 50 decimal places using mpmath
- **Statistical Tests**: Paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- **Confidence Level**: 95%
- **Reference**: Rosser-Schoenfeld bounds for nth prime validation

## Results (CORRECTED)

### Error Analysis
- **Z5D Mean Relative Error**: 0.054088 (5.41%)
- **LI Mean Relative Error**: 0.005418 (0.54%)
- **Error Ratio**: 9.98x (Z5D performs ~10x worse than LI)

### Statistical Significance
The hypothesis that "Z5D achieves lower relative errors than LI" is **REJECTED**.
LI significantly outperforms Z5D with nearly 10x lower error rates.

### CRISPR Simulation Performance
Based on the corrected error rates, LI predictor would provide superior performance 
for CRISPR applications requiring accurate prime predictions.

## Conclusions

### Hypothesis Testing
The null hypothesis H₀: "Z5D achieves lower relative errors than LI" is **REJECTED** 
with high confidence. The experimental evidence strongly contradicts the original claim.

### Practical Implications
- LI predictor demonstrates superior accuracy for nth prime approximation
- Z5D predictor shows significantly higher error rates and would not provide 
  computational advantages in CRISPR applications
- The original hypothesis claiming Z5D superiority was based on incorrect formulation

### Scientific Rigor
This correction demonstrates the importance of:
1. Clearly distinguishing between π(x) and p_n approximations
2. Validating mathematical formulations before experimental implementation
3. Using independent reference standards for validation

## Reproducibility

All calculations use high-precision arithmetic (50 decimal places) with fixed 
random seeds for reproducible results. The corrected experiment can be replicated using:

```python
experiment = Z5DPerformanceExperiment(min_n=1000000, max_n=10000000, num_samples=10)
result = experiment.run_experiment()
```

## Limitations

1. Computational constraints limited testing to n ≤ 10⁷ instead of 10⁹
2. Reference values use high-quality approximations rather than exact computation
3. CRISPR simulation remains simplified for demonstration purposes

## Future Work

1. Investigate why the original Z5D formula was expected to outperform LI
2. Test alternative high-precision nth prime approximations
3. Validate results against established mathematical literature
4. Examine potential applications where Z5D might have advantages
