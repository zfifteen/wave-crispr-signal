    Report:
      Clinical indication:History of vertebral body fracture., Severe
      back pain

      Comparison exam:Right film examination of [DATE]

      Technique:Localizer, T2 TSE sagittal, T2 STIR sagittal, T1 TSE
      sagittal, T2 TSE axial, T1 TSE axial

      Findings: There is some mild right curvature.

      Sagittal:The vertebral bodies of normal height, alignment and
      signal intensity. The intervertebral disc spaces are well
      preserved. There is no abnormal signal in the cord.

      Axial:

      T1-T2: There is no neural foraminal narrowing or canal
      compromise.

      T2-T3:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T3-T4:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T4-T5:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T5-T6:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T6-T7:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T7-T8:There is a right paracentral disc protrusion causing
      ventral dural impress. There is no significant neural foraminal
      narrowing or canal compromise.

      T8-T9:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T9-T10:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T10-T11:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T11-T12:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.

      T12-L1:No neural foraminal narrowing or canal compromise.



    Impression:


      There is a right paracentral disc protrusion causing ventral
      dural impress. There is no significant neural foraminal narrowing
      or canal compromise

      Some mild right curvature.
