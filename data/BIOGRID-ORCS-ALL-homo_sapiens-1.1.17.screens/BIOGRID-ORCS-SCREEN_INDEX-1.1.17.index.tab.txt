The custom positive set included genes essential in at least 90% of cell lines in both the CERES Avana dataset (PMID:29083409) and the 10 cell lines included in Bertomeu et al. (PMID:29038160). The custom negative set included genes essential in zero cell lines from one of the two datasets and in <=10% of the other dataset.
