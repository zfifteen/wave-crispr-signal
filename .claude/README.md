# Claude Sonnet 4 Configuration

This directory contains configuration and instruction files for Claude Sonnet 4 to enable deep research capabilities on the WAVE-CRISPR project.

## Files

- **claude_instructions_crispr_wave_signal.md**: Comprehensive knowledge bootstrap document that provides Claude Sonnet 4 with complete context about the WAVE-CRISPR framework, including:
  - Project overview and mathematical foundations
  - Scientific methodology and validation requirements
  - Mandatory scientific gates for data validation
  - Experimental procedures and statistical testing protocols
  - Development guidelines and troubleshooting tips
  - Deep research workflows and collaboration guidelines

- **settings.json**: Model configuration specifying Claude Sonnet 4 and its capabilities for this project.

## Purpose

These files enable Claude Sonnet 4 to:

1. **Conduct Scientific Research**: Perform rigorous analysis with proper statistical validation
2. **Design Experiments**: Create reproducible experiments following project standards
3. **Validate Results**: Ensure all work meets mandatory scientific gates
4. **Extend the Framework**: Propose and implement theoretically-grounded extensions
5. **Review Code**: Provide scientifically-informed code reviews
6. **Generate Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation following project conventions

## Comparison with Grok

This configuration is analogous to the Grok instructions in `.grok/` but tailored specifically for Claude Sonnet 4's capabilities and interaction model. Both systems share the same scientific standards and repository policies but may have different approaches to code execution and analysis.

## Usage

When working with Claude Sonnet 4 on this project, reference these instructions to ensure:

- Compliance with all scientific gates (data validation, statistical rigor, reproducibility)
- Proper use of the Z Framework with high-precision calculations
- Correct handling of DNA/RNA sequences (human genome only, proper nucleotide validation)
- Adherence to repository structure and naming conventions
- Appropriate statistical testing with bootstrap CIs and permutation tests

## Updates

Keep this documentation synchronized with:
- `.github/REPOSITORY_POLICY.md` - Repository structure and policies
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Development guidelines
- `CLAUDE.md` - Main repository guidance for Claude Code
- `docs/` - Scientific documentation
