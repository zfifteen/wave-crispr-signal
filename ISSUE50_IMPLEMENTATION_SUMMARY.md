## Results Demonstration

The framework successfully executed H1 testing on real CRISPR data:

```
Scale: 100 sequences
Bio-anchored: RMR = -1.492 [-5.390, 0.251], p = 0.375
Arbitrary: RMR = 0.040 [-0.313, 0.263], p = 0.791
```

This demonstrates:
- âœ… Statistical framework functioning correctly
- âœ… Bio vs arbitrary comparison working
- âœ… Bootstrap CIs calculated properly
- âœ… Results saved in required formats
- âœ… Visualization plots generated

## Usage

```bash
# Run complete experiment
cd wave-crispr-signal
python experiments/issue50_experiment.py

# Run validation tests
python tests/test_issue50_experiment.py

# Check generated results
ls results/  # issue50_summary.json, issue50_table.csv, *.png
ls logs/     # issue50_[timestamp].log
```
