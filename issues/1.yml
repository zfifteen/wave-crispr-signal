title: 'Recreate DNA Experiments Using Actual Human Samples'
body: '### Objective
Recreate all DNA-related experiments in the repository using authentic human DNA samples.

### Requirements
1. Identify a reliable and ethical source for downloading actual human DNA samples.
2. Ensure the dataset is large and diverse enough to support meaningful and reproducible experiments.
3. Modify existing experiments to utilize the human DNA samples.
4. Document detailed steps, findings, and deviations for each experiment.
5. Store the human DNA dataset in the repository or link to the dataset if storing it is impractical due to size constraints.

### Guidelines
- Follow all ethical considerations and legal regulations for handling human genetic data.
- Ensure reproducibility of the experiments by providing clear instructions and scripts.
- Validate results against the existing dataset and document discrepancies.

### Deliverables
- Updated experiments using human DNA samples.
- Documentation and scripts for reproducibility.
- Storage or link to the DNA dataset.

### Notes
Ensure compliance with Z Framework Guidelines for Code Generation and scientific precision in all updates.'
