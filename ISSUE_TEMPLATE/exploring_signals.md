# Objective
Design and implement tests to explore potential signals arising from explicit molecular dynamics within the Z Framework. While explicit molecular dynamics are currently not modeled, this issue will evaluate whether incorporating these dynamics could reveal meaningful patterns or invariants.

# Proposed Approach
1. **Define Molecular Dynamics Representation**:
   - Use simplified or coarse-grained molecular dynamics representations for DNA sequences.
   - Consider incorporating physical properties such as base-pair energetics, stacking interactions, and steric constraints.

2. **Augment the Z Framework**:
   - Extend the discrete domain form (Z = n(Δₙ/Δₘₐₓ)) to include terms or adjustments based on molecular dynamics.
   - Test whether geodesic curvature normalization (θ′(n,k)=φ·((n mod φ)/φ)^k) reveals patterns when applied to molecular dynamics-influenced data.

3. **Empirical Validation**:
   - Apply the extended Z Framework to both random and real-world DNA sequences.
   - Compare results against benchmarks (e.g., CRISPR efficiencies, sequence conservation).
   - Use mpmath for high-precision calculations and verify results under various molecular dynamics parameterizations.

4. **Falsification Tests**:
   - Introduce controlled perturbations to molecular dynamics parameters to evaluate the robustness of observed signals.
   - Document any inconsistencies or lack of convergence.
