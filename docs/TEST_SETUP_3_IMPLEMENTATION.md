# Test Setup 3 Implementation

## Overview

Test Setup 3 has been successfully implemented to expand the Z Framework test coverage beyond the original 3 core tests. The implementation organizes tests into three logical setups:

## Test Organization

### Test Setup 1: Core Framework Tests
- **Z Framework Core** (`tests/test_z_framework.py`)
- **Invariant Features** (`tests/test_invariant_features.py`) 
- **Geodesic Bridge** (`tests/test_geodesic_bridge.py`)

These are the foundational tests for the Z Framework mathematical implementation.

### Test Setup 2: Mathematical Analysis Tests
- **Topological Analysis** (`tests/test_topological_analysis.py`)

This test validates the f(x) = arcsin((x-1)/(2x+3)) topological properties and geodesic curvature connections.

### Test Setup 3: Application Tests
- **CRISPR Simple** (`tests/test_crispr_simple.py`)

This test validates the CRISPR guide design functionality and signal-theoretic DNA analysis.

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Test Runner
The `run_tests.py` script has been updated to:
- Support multiple test setup configurations
- Provide detailed breakdown by test category
- Set proper PYTHONPATH for module imports
- Enhanced error reporting and summary statistics

### Test Coverage Expansion
- **Before**: 3 tests (core framework only)
- **After**: 5 tests across 3 logical setups
- **Coverage**: Core framework, mathematical analysis, and applications

### Dependencies and Fixes
- Fixed missing constants in `topological_analysis.py`:
  - Added `DOMAIN_X_START = 0.01` for safe analysis domain
  - Added `geodesic_n0_offset = 1e-10` for n=0 case handling
- Fixed logging format issues in density enhancement analysis
- Updated test path resolution for CRISPR application tests

## Test Results

All 5 tests pass successfully:
```
Core Framework Tests: 3/3
Mathematical Analysis Tests: 1/1  
Application Tests: 1/1
OVERALL: 5/5 tests passed ðŸŽ‰
```

## Usage

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

The test runner automatically detects and runs all configured test setups, providing comprehensive validation of the Z Framework implementation.

## Future Expansion

The modular test setup structure allows for easy addition of:
- Additional mathematical analysis tests (Test Setup 2 expansion)
- More CRISPR application tests (Test Setup 3 expansion)
- New test categories (Test Setup 4+)

This provides a solid foundation for continued test coverage expansion while maintaining backward compatibility with existing CI workflows.
