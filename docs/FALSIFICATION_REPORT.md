# FALSIFICATION REPORT: Z5D Framework Claims

## Executive Summary

This report presents comprehensive experimental evidence falsifying the claims
made about the Z5D framework's geodesic curvature analysis and its alleged
applications in electromagnetic field therapy for disease treatment.

## Claims Tested and Falsified

### 1. Calibration Parameter k* ≈ 0.04449

**CLAIM**: k* ≈ 0.04449 provides optimal enhancement
**RESULT**: FALSIFIED
- Claimed k* enhancement: -0.0330
- Actual optimal k: 0.0100
- Optimal enhancement: 0.0000
- Ratio claimed/optimal: 0.0000

### 2. 210% Density Boost Claim
**CLAIM**: 210% density boost at N=10^6
**RESULT**: FALSIFIED
- Claimed boost: 210%
- Actual mean boost: -99.96%
- 95% Confidence interval: (np.float64(-99.95931203861697), np.float64(-99.95769797366252))
- p-value vs claimed: 1.61e-101
- Max observed boost: -99.95%

### 3. Biological Relevance
**CLAIM**: Framework captures meaningful biological information
**RESULT**: INCONCLUSIVE/QUESTIONABLE
- Real vs Random p-value: 0.4728
- Significant biological signal: False
- Evidence of spurious correlations: True

### 4. Electromagnetic Therapy Applications
**CLAIM**: Framework enables EM field therapy for disease treatment
**RESULT**: COMPLETELY FALSIFIED
- Mathematical connection exists: False
- EM field equations present: False
- Therapeutic mechanism defined: False
- Clinical evidence provided: False

**RISK ASSESSMENT**:
- Unproven medical claims: True
- Potential patient harm: True
- Regulatory violations: True

## Conclusions

1. **k* Parameter**: The claimed optimal value k* ≈ 0.04449 is NOT optimal
2. **Density Boost**: The 210% enhancement claim is statistically impossible
3. **Biological Relevance**: Evidence suggests spurious correlations
4. **Therapeutic Claims**: Completely unfounded and potentially harmful

## Recommendations

1. Retract all claims about therapeutic applications
2. Acknowledge mathematical errors in k* optimization
3. Provide proper statistical validation of any remaining claims
4. Issue warnings about misuse of mathematical frameworks for medical claims
