# PR #37 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Pull Request #37 ("Establish formal repository structure policy and enforce through AI assistant integration") was implemented on August 20, 2025, addressing Issue #36 for maintaining standard project layout.

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Policy Document
- **Added**: `.github/REPOSITORY_POLICY.md` (~318 lines)
- **Purpose**: Formalized "flat scientific module" layout
- **Scope**: Directory structure, naming conventions, quality standards

### 2. AI Assistant Integration  
- **Updated**: `.github/copilot-instructions.yml`
- **Enhancement**: Marked repository policy as **mandatory**
- **Integration**: Connected policy enforcement to Copilot workflows

## Policy Framework Established

└── *.md               # Research documents
```

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for core modules
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings required
- **Dependencies**: Exact version pinning in requirements.txt
- **Reproducibility**: Mathematical claims must be validatable

## Rationale

The policy conversion moved the repository from ad-hoc structure to explicit standards:

1. **Reduced Entropy**: Clear placement rules prevent structural drift
2. **AI Integration**: Copilot enforcement provides continuous compliance checking  
3. **Scientific Rigor**: Reproducibility requirements protect research integrity
4. **Onboarding Speed**: New contributors can quickly understand organization

## Follow-up Actions (Issue #38)

The policy established the framework but required additional enforcement mechanisms:

- CI/CD workflow for automated policy checking
- CODEOWNERS for structural change protection  
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Self-checking tools for policy validation

## Repository Status Post-PR-37

- ✅ Structure formalized and documented
- ✅ AI assistant integration configured
- ✅ Quality standards established
- ✅ Current repository already compliant with policy
- ⚠️ Enforcement mechanisms needed (addressed in subsequent issues)
