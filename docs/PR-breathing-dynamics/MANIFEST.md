## Testing Instructions

### Quick Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run main experiment
python experiments/test_breathing_dynamics_encoding.py

# Expected output should show:
# - Cohen's d ≈ +4.13 for GC-affecting
# - p-value < 0.000001
# - Winner: BREATHING
# - "✓ HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED"
```

### Full Validation (10 minutes)
```bash
# Run unit tests
python tests/test_breathing_dynamics.py

# All tests should pass (15 tests)
# Expected output: "OK" with 0 failures
```

### Reproducibility Test
```bash
# Run twice and compare
python experiments/test_breathing_dynamics_encoding.py > run1.txt 2>&1
python experiments/test_breathing_dynamics_encoding.py > run2.txt 2>&1
diff run1.txt run2.txt

# Should be identical (both use seed=42)
```

### Biological Data

- GC pairs: ~10^9 Hz (1 GHz)
- Helical periodicity: 10.5 bp per turn (structural biology)

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
1. **Synthetic data only**: Not yet tested on real CRISPR efficiency data
2. **Single property**: Only breathing dynamics (not combined)
3. **Simple mutations**: Only single-point substitutions
4. **Short sequences**: 20 bp guides (standard but limited)

### Planned Future Work
1. **Real data validation**: Test on Doench 2016, Kim 2025 datasets
2. **Combined encoder**: Breathing + electronic transitions + torsional
3. **Multi-mutation**: Deletions, insertions, complex variants
4. **Longer sequences**: Full gene contexts

### Statistical Considerations
1. **Multiple testing**: 3 mutation types tested (controlled via Bonferroni)
2. **Synthetic data**: May not capture all real biological complexity
3. **Z-score metric**: May not perfectly correlate with experimental efficiency
