This document compares the two AI assistant configurations available for the WAVE-CRISPR project.

## Overview

Both Grok and Claude Sonnet 4 are configured to assist with research on the WAVE-CRISPR signal-theoretic DNA analysis framework. They share the same scientific standards and repository policies but have different strengths and interaction models.

## Configuration Files

### Grok (.grok/)
- **Instructions:** `grok_instructions_crispr_wave_signal.md` (459 lines)
- **Settings:** `settings.json` (model: grok-code-fast-1)
- **Focus:** Code execution, validation, quick iterations

### Claude Sonnet 4 (.claude/)
- **Instructions:** `claude_instructions_crispr_wave_signal.md` (1372 lines)
- **Settings:** `settings.json` (model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- **Focus:** Deep research, comprehensive analysis, detailed documentation

## Shared Standards

Both assistants must comply with:

1. **Scientific Gates**
   - Human DNA only (GRCh38/hg38)
   - DNA: A/C/G/T/N validation only
   - RNA: A/C/G/U/N validation only
   - Fail-fast validation with clear error messages
   - No sequence fabrication

2. **Z Framework Domain Constraints**
   - Default discrete/biological: Z = A(B / e²)
   - Geometric resolution: θ'(n,k) = φ·((n mod φ)/φ)^k
   - Default k ≈ 0.3 for 21-nt guides
   - High precision: mpmath with dps=50

3. **Statistical Validity**
   - Pre-registered endpoints
   - Bootstrap CI (≥1,000 resamples)
   - Permutation tests (≥1,000×)
   - Leakage control (split-by-screen, split-by-gene)
   - Multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR)

4. **Reproducibility**
   - CLI contract (--seed, --bootstrap, --permutation, etc.)
   - Metadata persistence (git commit, dataset SHA256, environment)
   - Exact version pinning
   - Python 3.12.* environment

5. **CI/CD**
   - Smoke tests (<5 seconds)
   - Full test suite with pytest
   - Experiment structure (script, README, manifest)
