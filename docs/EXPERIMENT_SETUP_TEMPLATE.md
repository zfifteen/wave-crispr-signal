# WAVE-CRISPR Experiment Design Template with Two Sequence Bands

This template provides a structured approach for designing experiments to validate claims in the WAVE-CRISPR framework, which applies the Z Framework (Z = A(B/c)) to signal-theoretic analysis of DNA sequences for CRISPR applications. It ensures empirical correctness, reproducibility, and alignment with rigorous scientific standards. It incorporates two sequence bands per scale value (e.g., small, medium, large dataset sizes), each testing a different encoding strategy (biological anchored vs. arbitrary) at the optimal k* (e.g., k* ≈ 0.3 for spectral density enhancement) to enhance precision by capturing variability across encoding types. Researchers should adapt sections for specific pull requests (PRs) or hypotheses, referencing resources like https://github.com/zfifteen/wave-crispr-signal for the latest spectral mappings or datasets, and https://github.com/zfifteen/unified-framework for geodesic integrations (latest enhancements include pre-computed zeta zeros for faster execution and validated ~15% density enhancement at k* = 0.3, CI [14.6%, 15.4%]).

1. Experiment Overview
   1.1 Objective
   Clearly state the experiment’s purpose and its relevance to the WAVE-CRISPR Framework.

Example: Validate that spectral features from complex-encoded DNA waveforms achieve a 15-25% improvement in CRISPR guide efficiency prediction (CI [14.6%, 15.4%]) with <0.01% error at dataset sizes ≥ 10^3 and Pearson r ≥ 0.5 for spectral entropy correlations, using two encoding bands (biological anchored vs. arbitrary) per scale at optimal k* ≈ 0.3 for precision.

1.2 Hypothesis
Formulate a falsifiable hypothesis grounded in prior evidence or theory.

Example: WAVE-CRISPR spectral analysis, with κ(n) = d(n) · ln(n+1) / e² and θ'(n, k) = φ · ((n mod φ)/φ)^k at optimal k* ≈ 0.3, achieves <0.01% error and 15-25% improvement in translation efficiency or CRISPR prediction (CI [14.6%, 15.4%]) with r ≥ 0.5 (p < 10^{-5}) for two encoding bands per scale (scales = 10^2, 10^3, 10^4 sequences).
Label extrapolations (e.g., scales > 10^5) as hypotheses.

1.3 WAVE-CRISPR Framework Classification
Specify the domain and parameters.

Physical: Z = T(v/c), where A = T, B = v, c = speed of light (not directly applicable).
Discrete: Z = n(Δₙ/Δₘₐₓ), where A = n, B = Δₙ, c = Δₘₐₓ.
Geometric: θ'(n, k) = φ · ((n mod φ)/φ)^k, with φ as the golden ratio.
Biological: Sequence analysis via BioPython Seq objects with complex encodings (e.g., A=1+0j, T=-1+0j, C=0+1j, G=0-1j).
Example: Biological domain with Δₙ computed via κ(n) and θ'(n, k* ≈ 0.3) for two encoding bands per scale.

2.3 Experimental Procedure
Provide a step-by-step protocol for reproducibility.

Setup: Clone repository, install dependencies (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt).
Initialization: Set parameters (e.g., scales = [10^2, 10^3, 10^4], k* = 0.3, encodings = [biological, arbitrary] per scale band, e.g., biological: polarizability-based, arbitrary: random complex weights).
Execution: Run spectral calculations (e.g., Z = n(Δₙ/Δₘₐₓ)) for both encoding bands per scale at optimal k*, with causality guards (|v| < c, Δₙ > 10^{-50}).
Data Collection: Log outputs in CSV (columns: iteration, scale, encoding, Z-score, error, time, r, p-value).
Control: Benchmark against traditional methods (e.g., Doench rules) and prior WAVE-CRISPR implementation.
Randomization: Use fixed seed (e.g., seed=42) for reproducibility.

Statistical Tests: Two-tailed t-test (α=0.05) to compare bands; Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
Power Analysis: Predefine sample size (e.g., n=1000 for 80% power to detect 15% effect size).
Causality Guards: Ensure |v| < c (physical), Δₙ > 10^{-50} (discrete), no zero-division.
