# Repository Enforcement Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

This document summarizes the repository policy enforcement infrastructure implemented to address Issue #38 follow-up requirements from PR #37.

### ✅ Infrastructure Added

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- `.github/workflows/policy-check.yml` - Automated enforcement workflow
  - Linting: ruff, black formatting check, mypy type checking
  - Testing: pytest with coverage measurement (≥80% requirement)
  - Notebook validation: nbmake for Jupyter notebook executability
  - Policy validation: runs repository policy self-checker

**Code Quality Automation**
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
  - ruff (fast Python linting)
  - black (code formatting)
  - isort (import sorting)
  - nbstripout (notebook cleanup)

**Review Protection**
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` - Requires human review for structural changes
  - GitHub configuration files
  - Core scientific modules
  - Documentation and policy files
  - Critical configuration files

**Development Tools**
- `tools/check_repo_policy.py` - Self-validation script
  - Validates directory structure
  - Checks file naming conventions
  - Verifies core module presence
  - Validates dependency pinning
  - Reports compliance status

**Developer Guidance**
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR compliance checklist
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Comprehensive contribution guide
- `docs/test-organization-strategy.md` - Test location guidance
- `docs/PR-37/implementation-summary.md` - Implementation traceability

### ✅ Repository Hygiene

**Documentation Links**
- Updated `README.md` with repository structure section
- Cross-linked repository policy from main documentation
- Added contributing guidelines and policy compliance references

**Test Organization**
- Documented dual test location strategy (legacy root + modern tests/)
- Clarified execution paths and discovery mechanisms
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing test runner

**Traceability**
- Created `docs/PR-37/` documentation for implementation history
- Linked policy rationale and structural decisions
- Provided reference links to original issue and PR

## 🔧 Administrator Actions Required

The following actions require repository administrator privileges:

### Branch Protection Setup
Enable branch protection on `main` branch with:
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Include administrators in restrictions
- ✅ Required status checks: "policy-check"
- ✅ Require at least 1 approving review
- ✅ Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed

### Repository Settings
- Enable "Always suggest updating pull request branches"
- Set default merge type to "Squash and merge"
- Enable "Automatically delete head branches"

## 🎯 Policy Enforcement Levels

**Automated (CI)**
- ✅ Code formatting and style (ruff, black)
- ✅ Test execution and basic coverage
- ✅ Repository structure validation
- ✅ Notebook executability checks

**Human Review (CODEOWNERS)**
- ✅ Core module modifications
- ✅ Repository policy changes
- ✅ GitHub configuration updates
- ✅ Documentation structural changes

**Development Tools**
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for immediate feedback
- ✅ Self-checker script for local validation
- ✅ PR template for submission guidance

## 📊 Current Repository Status

**Compliance Assessment**
```bash
$ python tools/check_repo_policy.py
🔍 Running repository policy checks...
==================================================
Required directories: ✓ PASS
Required files: ✓ PASS
Naming conventions: ✓ PASS (3 warnings - legacy files)
Core modules: ✓ PASS
Test structure: ✓ PASS
Dependencies: ✓ PASS
==================================================
🎉 All policy checks PASSED!
```

**Test Coverage Status**
- Core framework tests: 3/3 passing
- Integration workflow: Functional
- Coverage measurement: Available (needs adjustment for subprocess tests)

## 🚀 Immediate Benefits

**For Contributors**
- Clear structural guidelines via policy document
- Automated feedback via pre-commit hooks and CI
- Comprehensive contributing documentation
- Self-service validation tools

**For Maintainers**
- Automated enforcement reduces manual review burden
- Consistent structure protects against entropy
- Human review required only for critical changes
- Traceability for policy decisions and changes

**For Research Integrity**
- Reproducibility requirements enforced
- Mathematical claims require validation
- Documentation standards maintained
- Scientific rigor preserved through automation

## 🔄 Next Steps

**Short Term**
1. Repository admin enables branch protection
2. Contributors install pre-commit hooks locally
3. New PRs use established template and validation

**Medium Term**
1. Monitor CI effectiveness and adjust thresholds
2. Gather feedback on enforcement mechanisms
3. Refine policy based on real-world usage

**Long Term**
1. Consider additional automated checks (security, dependencies)
2. Expand documentation for complex use cases
3. Evolve policy as project grows and matures

## 📋 Reference Checklist

From original Issue #38 requirements:

**Governance & gates**
- ✅ Add `/.github/workflows/policy-check.yml` with comprehensive checks
- ✅ Document branch protection requirements (admin action needed)
- ✅ Add `CODEOWNERS` for structural change protection

**Tooling & docs**
- ✅ Commit `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with quality tools
- ✅ Add policy self-checker script (`tools/check_repo_policy.py`)
- ✅ Add PR template with compliance checklist
- ✅ Add traceability documentation (`docs/PR-37/`)

**Repository hygiene**
- ✅ Document dual test location strategy
- ✅ Verify `wave-ribonn/README.md` exists (comprehensive)
- ✅ Cross-link REPOSITORY_POLICY.md from README
- ✅ Add comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md
